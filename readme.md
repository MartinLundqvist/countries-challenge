# REST Countries API front end challenge

This is a submission to a [frontendmentor.io](https://frontendmentor.io) challenge called [REST Countries API with color theme switch](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca).

The result can be viewed at [lyndenspacetourism.netlify.app](https://lyndenspacetourism.netlify.app/).

## Technologies used

- Typescript
- Vite.js
- React / React-Router-DOM
- Styled-Components
- Netlify

## Learning goals

- Implement a scalable React architecture pattern which could be used for a much larger application
- Minimize network calls and build a really fast application. I ended up using a Class based API for managing data and associated logic
- Build a responsive app with minimum use of media-queries
- Continue improving CSS skills (Grid, Flex and image handling specifically)

## Current issues

- Image size handling is still far from perfect. Flags don't come out perfect on some device sizes
- The country detail page is generally suffering from my poor design skills...
- Further issues may appear...
